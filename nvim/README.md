# My NeoVim Config

Check `install.sh` for a rough idea of requirements. It will try install them for you.

Also good to check [your-zsh-config](https://gist.github.com/ingalless/cddfb45947a81a63dcb4189fd3411aee) as that makes the whole experience all the more beautiful.

You probably also want to install [wsltty](https://github.com/mintty/wsltty) if on Windows
